# ── PIXIE — app + video pipeline in one container ──
#
# Node serves the frontend and every /api/* route, and shells out to ffmpeg
# and yt-dlp for the Slide 2 video feature. These used to be a separate
# Python/FastAPI service because Vercel caps serverless request bodies at
# 4.5 MB, so a video upload could not pass through the backend at all. On
# Railway that limit doesn't exist, so the split bought nothing but a second
# container, a shared secret, HMAC tokens and CORS config.
#
# yt-dlp ships a self-contained PyInstaller binary for Linux, so no Python
# runtime is needed here.

# ── JavaScript runtime for yt-dlp ──
# YouTube requires solving a JS challenge to decipher stream URLs. yt-dlp
# calls extraction without a JS runtime "deprecated", and without one only
# the android_vr and tv_embedded clients work at all — every web-based
# client fails with "Requested format is not available". Deno is the runtime
# yt-dlp enables by default, so installing it unlocks the full client set
# and the best available formats.
